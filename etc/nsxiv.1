.SH DESCRIPTION
nsxiv is a simple image viewer for X.
.P
It has two modes of operation: image and thumbnail mode. The default is image
mode, in which only the current image is shown. In thumbnail mode a grid of
small previews is displayed, making it easy to choose an image to open.
.P
Please note, that the fullscreen mode requires an EWMH/NetWM-compliant window
manager.

Please see xrdb(1) on how to change them.
.LP
An X resources entry with an empty value means the default
(defined in config.h) will be used.
.SH WINDOW TITLE
The window title can be replaced with the output of a user-provided script,
which is called by nsxiv whenever any of the relevant information changes.
The path of this script is
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nsxiv/exec/win-title
and the arguments given to it (where "Optional" arguments might be empty) are:
.IP $1 4
resolved absolute path of the current file
.IP $2 4
current file number
.IP $3 4
total file count
.IP $4 4
image width (Optional: Disabled on thumbnails mode)
.IP $5 4
image height (Optional: Disabled on thumbnails mode)
.IP $6 4
current zoom (Optional: Disabled on thumbnails mode)
.P
The term file is used rather than image as nsxiv does not precheck that the
input files are valid images. Total file count may be different from the actual
count of valid images.
.P
There is also an example script installed together with nsxiv as
.IR EGPREFIX/win-title .
.SH STATUS BAR
The information displayed on the left side of the status bar can be replaced
with the output of user-provided script.
.P
The script that is called by nsxiv whenever an image gets loaded is located at
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nsxiv/exec/image-info
and the arguments given to it are:
.IP $1 4
path to image file (as provided by the user)
.IP $2 4
image width
.IP $3 4
image height
.IP $4 4
fully resolved path to the image file
.P
In thumbnail mode, the script that is called is located at
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nsxiv/exec/thumb-info
and the arguments given to it are:
.IP $1 4
path to image file (as provided by the user)
.IP $2 4
empty
.IP $3 4
empty
.IP $4 4
fully resolved path to the image file
.P
There are also example scripts installed together with nsxiv as
.IR EGPREFIX/image-info
and
.IR EGPREFIX/thumb-info .
.SH EXTERNAL KEY HANDLER
Additional external keyboard commands can be defined using a handler program
located in
.IR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nsxiv/exec/key-handler .
The handler is invoked by pressing
.BR Ctrl-x .
The next key combo is passed as its first argument. Passed via stdin are the
images to act upon: all marked images, if in thumbnail mode and at least one
image has been marked, otherwise the current image. nsxiv(1) will block until
the handler terminates. It then checks which images have been modified and
reloads them.

By default nsxiv(1) will send one image per-line to stdin, however when using
\-0 the image list will be NULL separated and the environment variable
"$NSXIV_USING_NULL" will be set to 1.

The key combo argument has the following form: "[C-][M-][S-]KEY",
where C/M/S indicate Ctrl/Meta(Alt)/Shift modifier states and KEY is the X
keysym as listed in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h without the "XK_" prefix.
If KEY has an uppercase equivalent, S-KEY is resolved into it. For instance,
K replaces S-k and Scedilla replaces S-scedilla, but S-Delete is sent as-is.

There is also an example script installed together with nsxiv as
.IR EGPREFIX/key-handler .
.SH THUMBNAIL CACHING
nsxiv stores all thumbnails under
.IR $XDG_CACHE_HOME/nsxiv/ .
.P
Use the command line option
.I \-c
to remove all orphaned cache files. Additionally, run the following command
afterwards inside the cache directory to remove empty subdirectories:
.P
.RS
find . \-depth \-type d \-empty ! \-name '.' \-exec rmdir {} \\;
